Pagefind's default search algorithm is a great choice for most circumstances, but some datasets might be improved by changing the way results are ranked.

A good example is sites with a mix of long and short pages, where the long pages tend to be the preferred result. In this case, tweaking the `pageLength` and/or `termFrequency` parameters can improve the search relevance for the specific content.

Ranking parameters are configured within the `ranking` option passed to Pagefind, which can optionally contain any or all of the available parameters.

> Ranking can be explored for your content via the [Pagefind playground](/docs/playground/).

## Configuring ranking parameters

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "Component UI" "sync-cfg-programmatic" >}}
Ranking parameters can be passed to the Component UI via `configureInstance`:

```javascript
import { configureInstance } from '/pagefind/pagefind-component-ui.js';

+configureInstance("default", {
+    ranking: {
+        // optional parameters, e.g:
+        pageLength: 0.75
+    }
+});
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Search API" "sync-cfg-searchapi" >}}
Ranking parameters can be passed to the JavaScript API via `pagefind.options()`:

```javascript
const pagefind = await import("/pagefind/pagefind.js");
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        // optional parameters, e.g:
+        termFrequency: 1.0,
+    }
});
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

> The examples below use the Search API syntax. For the Component UI, pass the same `ranking` object to `configureInstance` as shown above.

## Configuring Term Frequency

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        termFrequency: 1.0 // default value
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

`termFrequency` changes the ranking balance between frequency of the term relative to document length, versus weighted term count.

As an example, if we were querying `search` in the sentence **"Pagefind is a search tool that can search websites"**, the term frequency of `search` is 0.22 (2 / 9 words), while the weighted term count of `search` is 2. This latter number would also include any [content with custom weights](/docs/weighting/).

- The maximum value is `1.0`, where term frequency fully applies and is the main ranking factor.
- The minimum value is `0.0`, where term frequency does not apply, and pages are ranked based on the raw sum of words and weights.
- Values between `0.0` and `1.0` will interpolate between the two ranking methods.

Reducing the `termFrequency` parameter is a good way to boost longer documents in your search results, as they no longer get penalized for having a low term frequency, and instead get promoted for having many instances of the search term.

## Configuring Term Similarity

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        termSimilarity: 1.0 // default value
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

`termSimilarity` changes the ranking based on similarity of terms to the search query. Currently this only takes the length of the term into account.

Increasing this number means pages rank higher when they contain words very close to the query,
e.g. if searching for `part`, a result of `party` will boost a page higher than one containing `partition`.

The minimum value is `0.0`, where `party` and `partition` would be viewed equally.

Increasing the `termSimilarity` parameter is a good way to suppress pages that are ranking well for long extensions of search terms.

## Configuring Page Length

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        pageLength: 0.75 // default value
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

`pageLength` changes the way ranking compares page lengths with the average page lengths on your site.

- The maximum value is `1.0`, where ranking will strongly favour pages that are shorter than the average page on the site, even if longer documents exist with a higher term frequency.
- The minimum value is `0.0`, where ranking will exclusively look at term frequency, regardless of how long a document is.

Decreasing the `pageLength` parameter is a good way to suppress very short pages that are undesirably ranking higher than longer pages.

## Configuring Term Saturation

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        termSaturation: 1.4 // default value
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

`termSaturation` controls how quickly a term "saturates" on a page. Once a term has appeared on a page many times, further appearances have a reduced impact on the page rank.

- The maximum value is `2.0`, where pages will take a long time to saturate, giving pages with very high term frequencies a boost in ranking.
- As this value trends to 0, it does not take many terms to saturate and allow other parameters to influence the ranking.
- The minimum value is `0.0`, where terms will saturate immediately and results will not distinguish between one term and many.

Decreasing the `termSaturation` parameter is a good way to suppress pages that are ranking well due to an extremely high number of search terms existing in their content.

## Configuring Diacritic Similarity

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        diacriticSimilarity: 0.8 // default value
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

`diacriticSimilarity` controls how much boost is applied when the diacritics (accents such as àéö) in the search query match the indexed content exactly.

When searching with diacritics normalized (the default behavior), this parameter determines the ranking bonus for exact diacritic matches:

- At `1.0`, searching for "café" will boost pages containing "café" by 100% over pages containing "cafe", and vice versa.
- The minimum value is `0.0`, which treats all diacritic variants equally.

This parameter has no effect when [`exactDiacritics`](/docs/search-config/#exact-diacritics) is set to `true`, as non-matching diacritic variants will not appear in results at all.

## Configuring Metadata Weights

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        metaWeights: {
+            title: 5.0 // default value
+        }
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

`metaWeights` controls which metadata field matches impact ranking. When a search term matches in a metadata field, the page's score is boosted by the weight configured for that field.

By default, Pagefind applies a 5x boost when search terms are found in the page title. This means a page with `astronomy` in its title will rank higher than a page with `astronomy` only in its body content.

- Each key in `metaWeights` corresponds to a metadata field name (e.g. `title` or any custom `data-pagefind-meta` field).
- Fields not specified default to `1.0` (no boost), except `title` which defaults to `5.0`.
- Setting a field's weight to `0.0` will prevent matches in that field from affecting the ranking.

For example, to boost author matches while keeping the default title boost:

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        metaWeights: {
+            author: 3.0,
+            description: 2.0
+        }
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}

To remove the default title boost, but still consider it when ranking:

{{< diffcode >}}
```javascript
await pagefind.options({
+    ranking: {
+        metaWeights: {
+            title: 1.0
+        }
+    }
});
```
{{< /diffcode >}}
